Welcome to my CSC 496 course project GitHub repository! This repository contains the code for a project website, 
which showcases my understanding of the basics of React and GatsbyJS. The site is a short blog site, meant to allow
me to explore the possibilities and potential of GatsbyJS

The website is hosted on GitHub Pages, so you can view it directly in your web browser without needing to download any files.

## Building the Website

The website is built using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript. I used HTML to structure the content, CSS for styling and layout, and JavaScript for interactivity and dynamic content.

Feel free to explore the code in this repository to see how I built my website. You can also use it as a starting point for your own website projects.

Overall, this was a fun project to work on and I had a great time learning the basics!
